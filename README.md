# Codeforces Solutions Repository by spexcher (Gourab Modak)

Welcome to the **Codeforces** repository! This repository contains solutions to various problems from **Codeforces**, organized by difficulty levels (A, B, C, D, E). Each folder contains solutions to problems corresponding to the problem ratings on Codeforces.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured into the following folders based on problem difficulty:

- **A**: Beginner-level problems (typically rated 800-1200).
- **B**: Intermediate-level problems (typically rated 1200-1600).
- **C**: Advanced-level problems (typically rated 1600-2000).
- **D**: Expert-level problems (typically rated 2000-2400).
- **E**: Master-level problems (typically rated 2400+).

## How to Use

Each folder contains solutions to problems written in C++ and Python programming languages (depending on the problem). You can explore the solutions by navigating to the appropriate folder and finding the solution file for the specific problem.

The file names usually correspond to the problem name or number on Codeforces. Each file also includes comments describing the approach and thought process behind solving the problem.
